# Welcome to the world of Bubble Sort
## The theory
We want to take a list of numbers and sort them in ascending order.
The core idea of bubble sort is to iterate through the list and swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Imagine we have a list of numbers:
{{numbers = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]}}
{{numbers}}

Too bad they're out of order! What does bubble sort do?
Imagine we start at positions 0 and 1.
The first two numbers are numbers[0] and numbers[1]. Let's see what happens after one iteration of bubble sort.
{{steps = 1}} 
{{newNumbers = include("bubbleRender", numbers, 1)}}

{{newNumbers}}

We can see that the first two numbers are swapped.
 
Now let's try the second step.
{{newNumbers = include("bubbleRender", numbers, 2)}}

{{newNumbers}}

We are now comparing 5 and 8. These are in the correct order, so we move on to the next pair.

{{newNumbers = include("bubbleRender", numbers, 3)}}

We are now comparing 8 and 4. These are in the wrong order, so we swap them.

We can render the full bubble sort process by setting steps to the length of the list.

{{return None}}

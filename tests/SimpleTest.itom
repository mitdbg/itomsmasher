# Welcome to the world of Bubble Sort
## The theory
We want to take a list of numbers and sort them in ascending order.
The core idea of bubble sort is to iterate through the list and swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Imagine we have a list of numbers:
{% set numbers = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2] %}
{{numbers}}
